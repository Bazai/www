## Overview

[Next](https://nextjs.org) is used as a static site generator. Pages call the `network` service that triggers `persistence` to read a post or a project from an MDX file in the `storage` directory.

Translation dictionary collection, RSS generation and image optimization are performed by custom scripts located in `ops`. For optimizing images, [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) is used.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io) is used as a test runner and [Hygen](https://www.hygen.io) as a code generator.

Deployed on static servers using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bespoyasov/www.git
cd www

npm i
```

## Development

For starting the development mode, run:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will start 3 daemons in parallel:

- Next dev server for En version on [2001 port](http://localhost:2001);
- Next dev server for Ru version on [2002 port](http://localhost:2002);
- Translation dictionary watcher for live-updates of localization data.

### Code Generation

Create a component, post, or a page:

```sh
npm run new:component
npm run new:post
npm run new:page

# Interactive CLI will guide you after this.
```

### Testing

To run the tests in development:

```sh
npm run test:dev
```

For running all the tests once:

```sh
npm test
```

The latter command is also used in CI.

## Project Build

The project can be built in 2 different languages:

```sh
npm run build:en
npm run build:ru
```

After the build, Next exports the generated site sources into `out`. Then the static resources are cleaned up to contain only the media related to the current build locale. In the end, RSS is generated.

The sources in `out` now can be deployed to a server.

## Ops

For operations that aren't included in Next by default, custom `ops` scripts are used.

### Image Optimization

To optimize images in `public/images` using Squoosh, run:

```sh
npm run images:convert
```

Next's Image component doesn't support optimizations when using SSG, hence this script.

Also, generated images are kept in the repository to avoid too long deployments. Since all images require optimizations, every update would last for tens of minutes.

### Translation

Instead of [using a third-party library and a localization service](https://github.com/bespoyasov/www/projects/6#card-80516724), the custom translation ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù is used.

It collects data from `translations.json` files in the `src` directory and creates a translation dictionary. Except the resulting dictionary, the type definitions for it are created. It improves the IDE support and autocompletion.

To collect translations, run:

```sh
npm run dict:collect
```

This command is run automatically after installing the dependencies and before project start and build.

To set up a watcher over the translation data that updates the dictionary on every `translations.json` file change, run:

```sh
npm run dict:watch
```

This command is run automatically on start of the project.

## Plans and TODOs

Everything I consider implementing is in the [projects section](https://github.com/bespoyasov/www/projects) on GitHub.
